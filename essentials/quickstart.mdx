## Quick Start

### First-time Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Unboxing Inspection">
Confirm the package contains the following items:
- RM-01 Main Unit
- CFexpress Card with pre-installed models and applications
- MicroSD Card
- Warranty Card
- Quick Start Guide
- USB-C Power Adapter
- USB-C to Ethernet Adapter
</Step>

<Step title="Connect Power">
- Connect the USB-C power adapter to the RM-01
- Connect the power adapter to a power outlet
</Step>

<Step title="Start the Device">
- Press the power button
- Wait for the device to boot (about 1-2 minutes)
- A steady white indicator light means the device is running normally
</Step>

<Step title="Device Connection">
Use a USB Type-C cable to connect RM-01 to your host device (computer, phone, or tablet). After the device is powered on, it will automatically configure the internal network, and your host will be assigned the static IP address: `10.10.99.100`

<Check>
After successful connection, your host's network interface will display as **AX88179A** or **RMinte RM-01** (depending on version)
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Internet Sharing (Optional)">
If you need RM-01 to access the internet, you can share the network through your host device. For macOS example:

1. Open **System Settings** > **Network** > **Sharing**
2. Enable **Internet Sharing**, select **Wi-Fi** as the sharing source
3. In "Share to devices", check the RM-01 network interface
4. Manually set the RM-01 network interface parameters:
   - **IP Address**: `10.10.99.100`
   - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`
   - **Router**: `10.10.99.100`
5. Click **Done**

<Tip>
This configuration makes the host act as a gateway, and RM-01 will automatically obtain the default gateway and DNS. If internet access is not needed, you can skip this step.
</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Accessing the Management Interface

RM-01 provides multiple management entry points, each corresponding to different functional modules:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="RobOS Monitoring Dashboard">
Access the real-time monitoring dashboard of the management module:

```
http://10.10.99.97
```

View the connection status and operation of each RM-01 module here, keeping track of device health in real-time.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Open WebUI Debugging">
Access the pre-installed Open WebUI on the application module:

```
http://10.10.99.99
```

**Default login credentials**:
- Username: `rm01`
- Password: `rm01`

<Warning>
After first login, please use SSH to log in (address: `10.10.99.99`) and immediately change the password to ensure security.
</Warning>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Inference Service Endpoint">
Directly access the API service of the inference module:

```
http://10.10.99.98:58000/v1/chat/completions
```

Supports standard OpenAI client calls, using tools like `openai-python`, Postman, or curl.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
If you have purchased or deployed other enterprise applications, they typically run on the application module (`10.10.99.99`). Please contact your service provider for specific port numbers and access methods.
</Info>

## Model Management

### Loading Open-Source Models (Automatic Mode)

RM-01 supports quick loading of open-source large language models (LLM), allowing you to easily verify model compatibility.

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare Model Files">
Using a **CFexpress Type-B** card reader, place the complete model weight files into the `auto/llm/` directory of the storage card.

Supported formats include: `.safetensors`, `.bin`, `.pt`, `.awq`, etc.

**Correct example**:
```
auto/llm/model-001-of-006.safetensors
auto/llm/config.json
auto/llm/tokenizer.json
auto/llm/vocab.json
```

<Warning>
Do not use subfolders! Files must be placed directly in the `auto/llm/` directory, not in subdirectories.

**Incorrect example**:
```
auto/llm/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-AWQ/model.safetensors
```
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Insert Storage Card and Start">
Insert the **CFexpress Type-B** storage card into RM-01 and restart the device. The system will automatically scan the `auto/llm/` directory and load compatible models.

<Check>
After the model is loaded, you can access the inference service through the inference service endpoint (`http://10.10.99.98:58000/v1/chat/completions`).
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Automatic Mode Limitations**:
- Only supports large language models (LLM), does not support embedding models or reranker models
- Suitable for quick verification of model compatibility, performance is limited (maximum context length ≤ 8192 tokens, memory usage rate ≤ 0.8)
- For higher performance or multi-model parallel deployment, please contact your service provider for **manual mode (dev)** technical support
</Note>
